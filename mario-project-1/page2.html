                <p>One night, Mario had a strange dream.<br> 
                    
                He found himself climbing a long staircase leading up to a mysterious door.<br>
                Opening the door, Mario's eyes fell upon an incredible world unlike anything he'd ever seen. <br>
                A quiet voice spoke to Mario, saying,<br><br>

                "Welcome to Subcon, the land of dreams.<br> 
                    Our once-beautiful world now suffers at the hands of the evil Wart.<br> 
                    Please help us! Only you can free us from his tyranny.<br> 
                    Oh, and remember one thing: Wart hates vegetables."<br><br>
                    
                However, before Mario could figure out what was happening, he suddenly awoke on his bed and realized that it was all a dream.<br> 
                
                The next day, while heading out to a picnic with his friends Luigi, Princess Toadstool, and Toad, Mario told the tale of his strange dream.<br>
                
                Hearing this was quite a shock to his friends, who all had the very same dream the night before.<br>
                    
                Upon arriving at their picnic spot, the group noticed a small cave.<br>
                
                Inside was a long staircase that led up to a door. At the top, the four friends opened the door and stood shocked by what they saw.<br><br> 
                
                It was Subcon - the world of their dreams!<br><br>
