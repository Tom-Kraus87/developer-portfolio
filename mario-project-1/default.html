            <h2>Super Mario Franchise (1985 - 1996)</h2>
                <p>The franchise revolves around the adventures of an extensive cast of recurring characters.<br>
                    The main protagonist of the franchise, the titular Mario, is a fictional Italian-American plumber who serves as the hero of a realm called the Mushroom Kingdom,<br>
                    which he endeavors to defend by traversing through stages filled with obstacles and enemies.<br><br> 
                    His arch-nemesis is Bowser, the king of the Koopas, a race of evil-driven anthropomorphic turtles.<br>
                    Bowser is responsible for the vast majority of the Mushroom Kingdom's invasions, and almost always appears as the final boss,<br> 
                    who consistently attempts to put an end to the escapades of Mario and his friends.<br><br>

                    Mario's younger but taller twin brother, Luigi, often participates in his adventures alongside him.<br> 
                    In early games, he was playable only in the two-player mode as a simple palette swap, but with the passage of time, he went on to gain more significant roles.<br> 
                    The Mushroom Kingdom's ruler, Princess Peach, is Mario's love interest and recurring damsel in distress.<br> 
                    She repeatedly gets kidnapped by Bowser and has to be rescued by Mario, but occasionally serves as a protagonist herself.<br>
                    Her kingdom's inhabitants and her personal servants are the Toads, a species of fungal creatures who often support Mario during his adventures.<br><br>
