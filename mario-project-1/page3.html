                <p>The Mushroom Kingdom has been a peaceful place thanks to the brave deeds of Mario and Luigi.<br> 
                The Mushroom Kingdom forms an entrance to the Mushroom World where all is not well.<br>

                Bowser sent his seven children to make mischief as they please in the normally peaceful Mushroom World.<br> 
                They stole royal magic wands from each country in the Mushroom World and used them to turn their kings into animals.<br><br>
                Mario and Luigi must recover the royal magic wands from Bowser's seven kids to return the kings to their true forms.<br>
                    
                "Goodbye and good luck!" said the Princess and Toad as Mario and Luigi set off on their journey deep into the Mushroom World.<br>
                    
                Peace has returned to the Mushroom Kingdom thanks to the efforts of Mario and Luigi.<br>
                However, Bowser sent his own seven children (Larry, Morton, Wendy, Iggy, Roy, Lemmy, and Ludwig) to the other countries of the Mushroom World,<br> 
                which the Mushroom Kingdom forms a gateway to.<br><br> 
                
                The Koopalings stole the royal magic wands of the seven kings, using them to transform the kings into various helpless creatures.<br> 
                Mario and Luigi vow to go and stop the Koopalings' mischief, and change the kings back into their normal form.<br> 
                At the end of each world, Mario and Luigi fight one of the Koopalings, and after the match is over, retrieve the wand from the Koopaling to turn the king back to normal.<br> 
                While the brothers are out in their adventure, Bowser kidnaps Princess Toadstool and takes her to his lair in Dark Land.<br> 
                The brothers go to Dark Land and fight Bowser.<br> 
                After defeating Bowser, they save the princess and restore peace once again.<br><br>
