                <p>After saving the Mushroom Kingdom from Bowser and the rest of the Koopas in Super Mario 3, Mario and Luigi needed to recuperate from their adventures.<br>
                Together they agreed that the best place to vacation was a magical place called Dinosaur Land.<br>

                But while Mario and Luigi reclined on the beach for a relaxing nap, Princess Toadstool disappeared, apparently seized by evil forces.<br>
                After searching for hours for their missing friend, Mario and Luigi came upon an enormous egg in the forest.<br>
                    
                Suddenly the egg hatched, and out popped a young dinosaur named YOSHI!<br>
                Who proceeded to tell Mario and Luigi a sad tale of how his dinosaur pals were sealed in similar eggs by a group of monstrous turtles.<br><br>
                    
                "Monstrous turtles!" exclaimed Luigi. "Bowser and his bunch have returned!" Mario slowly nodded his head in agreement.<br> 
                Mario, along with Luigi and Yoshi, set off across Dinosaur Land to find the Princess and to free Yoshi's friends.<br> 
                
                As they began their journey, Yoshi handed Mario a beautiful cape. <br>
                "This may help you," said Yoshi. "Some say it has magical powers."<br>
                    
                With a little luck (and help from a magic cape), our hearty crew can defeat the seven worlds of Bowser's Krazy Koopa Kritters.<br> 
                
                After Bowser's previous defeat, Mario, Luigi, and Princess Toadstool decide to recuperate in Dinosaur Land.<br>
                Meanwhile, in Dinosaur Land, Bowser and his Koopalings trap Yoshi and his friends in enchanted eggs, eliminating the opposition as they secretly rebuild their forces.<br><br> 
                Shortly upon their arrival, the Mario Bros. realize that Princess Toadstool is missing.<br> 
                While searching, they find the Koopa Troop.<br> 
                Upon the Mario Bros. freeing the friendly Yoshi, he exclaims that the Koopas have invaded, confirming that Bowser has indeed returned and taken the opportunity to claim the princess.<br>
                    
                As Mario and his friends travel through Dinosaur Land, they uncover the Valley of Bowser, where Bowser is fought on his castle roof in his Koopa Clown Car, holding Toadstool hostage.<br> 
                Upon his defeat, he gently drops the princess and retreats.<br>
                Toadstool rewards Mario or Luigi with a kiss as fireworks celebrate freedom, signifying that their vacation can resume with their new good friends.<br> 
                The reunited team returns to Yoshi's House, where the team and three other Yoshis watch the eggs hatch into babies, removing the spell.<br><br>
