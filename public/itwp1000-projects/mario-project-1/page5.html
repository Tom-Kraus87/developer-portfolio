                <p>The game begins with a letter from Princess Peach inviting Mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him.<br> 
                When he arrives, Mario discovers that Bowser has invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess and her servants within its walls using the power of the castle's 120 Power Stars.<br> 
                The Power Stars are hidden in the castle's paintings, which serve as portals to other worlds where Bowser's minions keep watch over the Stars.<br><br> 
                Mario explores the castle and enters these worlds, gaining access to more rooms as he recovers more Stars.<br>
                Mario unlocks two doors to different floors of the castle with keys obtained by defeating Bowser in hidden worlds.<br>
                After getting at least 70 of the 120 Stars, Mario breaks the curse of the endless stairs that block the entrance to Bowser's final hiding place.<br>
                After Mario defeats Bowser in the final battle, and Bowser escapes, swearing revenge, he obtains a special Power Star which gives him the Wing Cap, and he flies back to the castle's courtyard.<br> 
                Peach is released from the stained-glass window above the castle's entrance, and she rewards Mario by kissing him on the nose and baking the cake that she had promised him.<br><br>
