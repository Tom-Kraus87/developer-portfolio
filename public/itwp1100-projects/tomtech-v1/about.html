        <h1>From IT support to Full-Stack Solutions: My Journey in Tech</h1>
        <p>My name is Tom Kraus, and I've spent over a decade in the tech industry, mastering a diverse range of IT skills and solutions that help businesses run smoothly and efficiently. My career began with a passion for understanding how things work - from the intricacies of hardware to the the seamless flow of data across networks. What started as a love for troubleshooting hardware and providing IT support has grown into a comprehensive skill set that allows me to address a wide array of technical challeneges.</p>

        <h2>The Foundation: IT Support & Administration</h2>
        <p>In the early days of my career, I cut my teeth by providing hands-on IT support, working with everyone from end-users to C-level executives. I became adept at diagnosing and resolving issues with hardware, software, and networks, regardless of the platform - be it Windows, Mac, iOS, or Android. Over time, I honed my ability to troubleshoot and configure everything from desktops and laptops to servers and networking hardware like routers and switches.</p>

        <h2>Moving Up: Supporting Businesses with Office 365 & VPN Solutions</h2>
        <p>My expertise soon expanded beyond individual troubleshooting into system-wide support. I became a go-to resource for Office 365 integration and VPN configurations, ensuring that teams could collaborate securely from anywhere in the world. Setting up, configuring, and monitoring servers became second nature, as did routine tasks of patching and backups, which kept company data safe and systems running efficiently.</p>

        <h2>Evolving Skill Set: Virtualization & Network Management</h2>
        <p>As I grew in my career, I embraced the evolving tech landscape by diving into virtualization techologies such as VMWare, Citrix, Hyper-V, and VirtualBox. My experience in Active Directory, DHCP, and PAN/LAN/WAN network management allowed me to optimize network performance and ensure seamless access to resources. I was responsible for monitoring systems, performing preventative maintenance, and keeping downtime to a minimum for my clients.</p>

        <h2>Adding Development Skills: Software Development, Testing, Scripting & Automation</h2>
        <p>To enhance my ability to solve complex problems, I turned to scripting and programming. Mastering PowerShell, Bash, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as mobile development using Java and Kotlin, allowed me to automate tasks, improve workflows, secure data, and ensure that routine IT processes were handled swiftly and accurately. Whether it was creating scripts to automate serve updates, testing websites and applications, or writing code to integrate different systems, I've leveraged these skills to make businesses more efficient and scalable.</p>

        <h2>The Next Chapter: Full-Stack Support & Freelance Consulting</h2>
        <p>Now, with a deep well of experience in IT support, system administration, software development, and network management, I'm excited to bring my skills to the freelance world. My focus is on providing tailored, full-stack solutions for businesses looking to optimize their tech infrastructure. Whether you need remote IT support, network design, software testing, server management, or even custom scripts and tools, I have the expertise to get the job done.</p>
