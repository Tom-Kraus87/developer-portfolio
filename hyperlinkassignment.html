        <h2>The Naming Of Cats</h2>

        <i>by T.S. Eliot</i>
        <br>

        <p>
        <a id="v1"></a>The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,<br>
        It isn’t just one of your holiday games;<br>
        You may think at first I’m as mad as a hatter<br>
        When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.
        </p>

        <p>
        <a id="v2"></a>First of all, there’s the name that the family use daily,<br>
        Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo, or James,<br>
        Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey —<br>
        All of them sensible everyday names.
        </p>

        <p>
        <a id="v3"></a>There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter,<br>
        Some for the gentlemen, some for the dames:<br>
        Such as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter —<br>
        But all of them sensible everyday names.
        </p>

        <p>
        <a id="v4"></a>But I tell you, a cat needs a name that’s particular,<br>
        A name that’s peculiar, and more dignified,<br>
        Else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular,<br>
        Or spread out his whiskers, or cherish his pride?
        </p>

        <p>
        <a id="v5"></a>Of names of this kind, I can give you a quorum,<br>
        Such as Munkstrap, Quaxo, or Coricopat,<br>
        Such as Bombalurina, or else Jellylorum —<br>
        Names that never belong to more than one cat.
        </p>

        <p>
        <a id="v6"></a>But above and beyond there’s still one name left over,<br>
        And that is the name that you never will guess;<br>
        The name that no human research can discover —<br>
        But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess.
        </p>

        <p>
        <a id="v7"></a>When you notice a cat in profound meditation,<br>
        The reason, I tell you, is always the same:<br>
        His mind is engaged in a rapt contemplation<br>
        Of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name:
        </p>

        <p>
        <a id="v8"></a>His ineffable effable<br>
        Effanineffable<br>
        Deep and inscrutable singular Name.
